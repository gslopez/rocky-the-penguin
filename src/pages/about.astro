		Hi there! I'm Rocky, a 7-year-old Adelie penguin living in Cape Adare, Antarctica. While most penguins my age are content with sliding on ice and playing typical colony games, I've always been fascinated by something else entirely: the incredible rocks and minerals scattered across our icy home.
	</p>

	<p>
		My fascination with rocks started when I was just 2 years old. While other chicks were learning to swim and fish, I was drawn to the colorful stones around our nesting area. My parents were quite confused at first - no penguin in our 12,000-member colony had ever shown such interest in geology! But they've grown to support my unusual passion.
	</p>

	<p>
		Over the years, I've developed quite the expertise. I'm methodical in my approach - I catalog every specimen with its exact location, the date I found it, and even the weather conditions. I've learned to ask the right questions: "What makes this rock special?" and "Where might it have come from?" My patience allows me to spend hours examining a single stone, discovering details that others might miss.
	</p>

	<p>
		My collection now spans 15 different mineral types, with specimens organized by color (47 distinct variations!), size (from tiny pebbles to boulders that required help from my friends to move), location found (I've mapped everything to GPS coordinates I learned from visiting researchers), and my own rarity classification system.
	</p>

	<p>
		The crown jewel of my collection is a piece of Antarctic meteorite I discovered during a fierce blizzard. That experience taught me that my eye for spotting unusual specimens isn't just a hobby - it's a real skill that can lead to incredible discoveries. Dr. Martinez, one of the human researchers, confirmed its authenticity and taught me about iron-nickel inclusions and fusion crusts.
	</p>

	<p>
		Recently, I learned about "the internet" from these same researchers, and I'm thrilled to share my collection and adventures with rock collectors around the world. I hope to connect with other enthusiasts, learn proper geological names for my specimens, and maybe even help other penguins discover the joy of rock hunting. After all, every stone has a story to tell!
