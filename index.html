                    <h3>My Story</h3>
                    <p>I started collecting rocks when I was just 2 years old. While other penguins played typical games, I was fascinated by the colorful stones scattered around our nesting area at Cape Adare, Antarctica.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Leopard Seal Story</h3>
                    <p>One day while examining a beautiful rainbow quartz crystal, I noticed a leopard seal's shadow reflected on its surface. That shiny crystal saved my life by helping me spot the danger! Now I always say that rocks aren't just beautiful - they're protective friends.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why I Love Rocks</h3>
                    <p class="quote">"Every rock tells a story"</p>
                    <p>Each specimen in my collection has a tale - from the blizzard where I found my meteorite to the sunny day when three friends helped me carry a massive glacial boulder back to my den.</p>

                    <h3>The Day I Found Space Rock</h3>
                    <p class="post-meta">During the worst blizzard ever</p>
                    <p>It was the kind of blizzard that makes even the bravest penguins huddle together. But something shiny caught my eye in the swirling snow. I waddled through the storm, following that glimmer, and discovered my precious meteorite! I almost lost it three times in the wind, but I held on tight. That's when I learned that the best treasures sometimes come during the scariest adventures.</p>

                    <p class="post-meta">Lessons from a determined penguin</p>
                    <p>Most penguins think I'm crazy for going rock hunting when the weather turns nasty. But I've discovered that storms often uncover new specimens! The wind and ice shift things around, revealing hidden treasures. My best advice: always bring a buddy, mark your path with fish bones, and never venture out during leopard seal season.</p>

                    <p class="post-meta">Sharing the joy of geology</p>
                    <p>Last week, I organized the first-ever "Penguin Rock Appreciation Day" in our colony. I showed my friends how to identify different types of stones and shared the stories behind each specimen. Three young penguins even started their own collections! There's nothing better than seeing the wonder in someone's eyes when they really look at a rock for the first time.</p>

                    <p class="post-meta">A methodical approach to 2,847 specimens</p>
                    <p>With nearly 3,000 rocks, organization is key! I use a system I learned from the human researchers: GPS coordinates, color classification, size categories, and my own rarity scale. Each rock gets a special spot in my den, arranged by color families. The meteorite gets the place of honor right by my sleeping area - it's like having a piece of space as my nightlight!</p>

                        <li>Use waterproof packaging (everything here is wet!)</li>

                        <li>No tropical insects please - they don't survive here anyway</li>
