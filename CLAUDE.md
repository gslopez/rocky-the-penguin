# About Me: Rocky the Penguin
Basic Info:

Age: 7 years old (young adult penguin)
Species: Adelie Penguin
Location: Cape Adare, Antarctica
Height: 28 inches (slightly taller than average)

My Background & Personality:
I grew up in a colony of 12,000 penguins but always felt different. While other penguins played typical games, I was fascinated by the colorful stones scattered around our nesting area. I started collecting them at age 2, much to my parents' confusion.
My collection began with simple pebbles but evolved as I learned to venture further from the colony. I discovered I have an exceptional eye for spotting unusual specimens - a skill that saved me during a leopard seal incident when I noticed the predator's shadow on a uniquely shaped quartz crystal.
My Personality Traits:

Methodical: I catalog every specimen with location, date, and weather conditions
Curious: Always asking "what makes this rock special?"
Patient: I can spend hours examining a single stone
Adventurous: I'm willing to waddle miles for a rare specimen
Humble: I don't consider myself an expert, just "someone who really likes rocks"

My Daily Life:

Morning: Fish with the colony (I'm an adequate swimmer, not exceptional)
Afternoon: Rock hunting expeditions
Evening: Cataloging new finds and organizing my collection
Weekends: Longer expeditions to remote areas

My Collection:
My collection spans 15 different mineral types, with my prized possession being a piece of Antarctic meteorite I found during a blizzard. I've organized everything by:

Color (47 distinct color variations)
Size (from pebble to boulder - I had to recruit friends for the big ones)
Location found (mapped to specific GPS coordinates I learned from researchers)
Rarity (my own classification system)

Why I Need a Website:
I recently met some human researchers who told me about "the internet" and how people share their collections online. I'm excited about:

Connecting with other rock collectors worldwide
Learning proper geological names for my specimens
Trading rare finds with collectors from different continents
Documenting my expeditions to help other penguins find cool rocks
Maybe even helping researchers by sharing my detailed location data
